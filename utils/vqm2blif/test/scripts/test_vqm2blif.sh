# The purpose of this script is to go through a number of .vqm files
# and generate the corresponding .blif files using the vqm2blif program.
# The generated blif files will be compared to a golden set of outputs
# to validate the vqm2blif program changes.

# This program accepts two arguments:
# Argument 1: Location of the directory that contains all the netlists
# Argument 2: Location of the architecture file that will be used when running the vqm2blif program

# if any of the arguments are not supplied, then default values will be used (see below for further information)

# This script assumes that the corresponding "golden" blif file for any vqm netlist is in the same directory and it is the ONLY blif file in the directory.
# See below for a sample directory structure:
# - netlists
#    - netlist_1
#       - circuit_1.vqm
#       - circuit_1.blif
#    - netlist_2
#       - circuit_2.vqm
#       - circuit_2.blif
#    - netlist_3

# please note that the original Titan benchmarks were arranged this way

# Finally, the generated blif files have the extension ".test.blif", so please do not name any other files with this extension


# has useful utilities

# location of the VTR project root directory

# location of the deafult architecture file used when testing the vqm2blif program

### useful file extensions ###
